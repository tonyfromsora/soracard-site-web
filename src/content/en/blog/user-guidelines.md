# **SORA Card User Guidelines**
**SORA Card is live and ready for use!**

We invite all early adopters—people who successfully passed KYC before July 2024—to follow the steps below before using their account and card:

**1. Early adopters: Request new IBAN before ordering a card**

**Note: The issuer will soon disable the initial emitted IBANs**. To use SORA Card with all its features, please add a new account and order your SORA Card from this account.

This will not incur any cost for you.

**If you are unsure about being an early adopter:**

If you can order a virtual card from your IBAN, you should do so. This means you are not considered an early adopter and do not need to add a new account before ordering your virtual card.

Additionally, when adding a new account next to your initial IBAN, the fee should be zer0 for early adopters.

If you are requested to pay a fee of €2.50 to add a new account, you do not need to add a new account to order your virtual card. If you are in the latter situation, you can order a SORA Card from the initial account free of charge.
## **Adding a New Account**
**How to add an account:**

* Go to Settings > Add accounts.

* Click on New > Select **Consumer account** and confirm

**2. Order your card through the new IBAN**

Early adopters should order their virtual card through the new IBAN account.
## **Ordering a Virtual Card**
New users can order their virtual cards from the issued IBAN.

Go to your new account and click the red ‘Order’ button to order a card.

Next: slide to confirm your details and the fee- **your first card is free of charge**.

Your virtual card will be issued in seconds.
Congratulations!

## **Topping up your SORA Card Balance**
You now have your very own virtual SORA Card. To spend your IBAN funds, top up your new card.

**3. For all users: Loading your card**

Click on your card in the app.

Then, click on the 'Load' button.
